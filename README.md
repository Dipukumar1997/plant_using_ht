## 🔍 Project Overview

This system is designed to help **farmers, researchers, and gardeners** by providing **instant, reliable plant disease detection** from leaf images. It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for classification, along with **Wikipedia** and **Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google AI)** to provide disease-related information and suggested remedies.

## 📦 Dataset & Model

The model is trained using the **PlantVillage dataset** and saved in `.h5` format.

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✅ Upload plant leaf images to predict diseases in real time  
- ✅ Display disease name, symptoms, and cure suggestions  
- ✅ Dual-source knowledge (Wikipedia + Gemini AI)  
- ✅ Fully responsive UI for mobile and desktop  
- ✅ Lightweight, fast, and informative  
- ✅ AI fallback ensures no empty responses  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads an image of a diseased leaf.
2. The backend (Flask + TensorFlow) runs inference using the trained CNN model.
3. Once the disease is identified:
   - The app fetches detailed info from **Wikipedia**.
   - If Wikipedia lacks data, **Gemini 1.5 Flash** generates a reliable fallback answer.
4. The user is shown disease name, symptoms, and treatment steps.
